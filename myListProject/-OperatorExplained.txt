I used override to make a new - operator that addes two lists together. If an item matches in the either of the lists only one instance of
that object is going to be in the new list rather than two. The way the method works is by testing the second list objects against the first
list objects.  If the second list object is the same as any of the first list objects it will not be added to the new list. if you were to 
add two lists listOne = {1,2,3} and listTwo = {3,4,5} the new list will be returned as a new NateList equalling {1,2,3,4,5}. The - operator
method takes in two instances of a nateList and returns a new instance of a NateList utilizing two for loops where the first one loops through 
the second list and the second for loop checks to see if that item from the second list is the same as anything from the first list.
